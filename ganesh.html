    <article>Ganesh Kishan (born 2 July 1978),[2] known mononymously as Golden Star Ganesh, is an Indian actor and
        television presenter known for his work in Kannada cinema. Through his career in films and television shows, he
        has become one of the most popular celebrities and highest-paid actors in Kannada cinema.[3] He is the recipient
        of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards.

        Ganesh shot to fame with the film Mungaru Male (2006), which set a record in Kannada cinema.[4] In theatres, it
        was speculated to have collected over ₹75 crore[1][5] by the end of its record-breaking 865-day theatrical
        run.[6] It was the first movie to be screened continuously for one year in a multiplex in any language in
        India.[7][8][9][10][11] The success of Mungaru Male brought Ganesh the nickname, "Golden Star".[12][13]

        Ganesh won two consecutive Best Actor awards at Filmfare for the romantic comedy-drama Gaalipata (2008) and in
        the romantic drama Maleyali Jotheyali (2009). His other major success was Cheluvina Chittara (2007) after
        Mungaru Male.[14] He then acted in Krishna (2007), Romeo (2012), Shravani Subramanya (2013), Zoom (2016) and
        Chamak (2017).</article>
